            <h4>ELK Project</h4>
            <p>This was a solo project, where I configured a Azure Cloud network with 4 vms, 2 network security groups and a load balancer. Installed docker containers to deploy a fully functional ELK stack. Configured ELK to use filebeat and metricbeat.</p>

            <h4>Red Team / Blue Team Project</h4>
            <p>This is a Red Team / Blue Team project that was composed of three parts. The first part I acted as the Red Team and was tasked with gaining access to a web server. The second part I acted as the Blue Team to analyze the Red Team attack. I used Kibana and the metricbeat, filebeat and packetbeat packages to view the logs. The third part consisted of proposed alarms and mitigation strategies.</p>
